A chess engine based on the Negamax algorithm with up to 10th depth game analysis. Utilizes alpha-beta pruning, the Principal variation search and the Quiescence search algorithms to find the next best move in a position. 

## Features
- Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Move ordering using the MVV-LVA heuristic
- Principal variation search
- Quiescence search
- Iterative deepening
- Piece-square tables


GUI includes undoing moves, flipping and resetting the board, under promotions, custom board positions and evaluation times.

## Possible Improvements
- Switching programming languages
- Using a better evaluation method
