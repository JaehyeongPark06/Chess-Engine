## About

A chess engine based on the Negamax algorithm with up to 10th depth game analysis. (if given enough time)

## Features

- Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Iterative deepening
- Piece-square tables
- Move ordering using the MVV-LVA heuristic
- Principal variation search
- Quiescence search
- Zobrist hashing

GUI includes undoing moves, flipping and resetting the board, under promotions, and custom board positions and evaluation times.

## Possible Improvements

- Switching programming languages
- Using a more detailed evaluation method (ex. use of opening tables)
- Transposition Tables
